# hello-world
My code learning journey!
Here i'm going to talk about my general experience with coding and what i'm planing to do right now and in the future.
I'm trying to learn c# with the intention of working with the unity framework and maybe with some opengl custom engines.
On top of that i would also like to learn some web development that being HTML,CSS,javascript etc maybe working in the future as a full stack web dev idk yet:)
Currently i'm just doing codewars katas and some random shit to test my skills, learn new stuff and experimante.
I'm trying to make a simple calculator with GUI using the c# forms in visual studio.
For now i only have the simple visual stuff semi functional.
